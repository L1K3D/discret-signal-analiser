# üì° Discrete Signal Analyzer - EN US

## Overview
The **Discrete Signal Analyzer** is a Python-based tool for processing discrete-time signals by applying **transformations** (time shift, reflection, and compression) and **analyzing system properties** (causality, memory, stability, time invariance, and linearity). It allows users to input a **custom signal** and observe the transformed outputs through graphical representations.

## üîß Features
- Accepts **up to 9 integers** as input for signal processing.
- Applies the following **signal transformations**:
  - **Time Shift**: Moves the signal forward by 2 units.
  - **Time Reflection**: Flips the signal over the time axis.
  - **Time Compression**: Reduces the time scale by a factor of 2.
- Implements **three discrete systems** for analysis:
  - **System 1**: Difference between consecutive samples \( y[n] = x[n] - x[n-1] \).
  - **System 2**: Cumulative sum (integrator) \( y[n] = \sum x[k] \).
  - **System 3**: Time compression \( y[n] = x[2n] \).
- Evaluates **five properties** of each system:
  - **Causality**
  - **Memory**
  - **Stability**
  - **Time Invariance**
  - **Linearity**
- Generates **stem plots** for visualizing discrete-time signals.

## üöÄ How to Install & Run

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (version **3.6+** recommended). Also, install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

### Running the Script
Clone the repository or download the script:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/discrete-signal-analyzer.git
cd discrete-signal-analyzer
```
Run the Python script:
```bash
python signal_analyzer.py
```

Upon execution:
1. The program will **ask for a sequence of up to 9 numbers**.
2. The script will validate the input and process the signal.
3. **Graphs** will be generated to visualize the **original signal** and **transformed signals**.
4. The system analysis will be displayed in the **terminal**.

```
Enter up to 9 integers separated by spaces: 0 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 0 0
```

### Output:
**Graphical Representation**
‚úÖ Original Signal  
‚úÖ Shifted Signal \( x[n-2] \)  
‚úÖ Reflected Signal \( x[-n] \)  
‚úÖ Compressed Signal \( x[2n] \)

## üìå Notes & Limitations
- The input signal **must be integers** in the range **-9 to 9**.
- The system **assumes causal behavior** based on non-negative indices.
- The **cumulative sum system is limited** to the input size provided.
- The **compressed signal may discard some values** depending on the length.
